# ARIMA-WWWusage
ARIMA Modelling on WWWusage Dataset

The WWWusage dataset is a time series of the numbers of users connected to the Internet through a server every minute.
I performed necessary data processing (removing deterministric variation, attaining stationarity) before fitting candidate ARIMA models by analysing ACF/ PACF and residual plots.
