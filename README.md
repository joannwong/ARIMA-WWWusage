# ARIMA Modelling on WWWusage Dataset

The WWWusage dataset is a time series of the numbers of users connected to the Internet through a server every minute.
I performed necessary data processing (removing deterministric variation, achieved stationarity through differencing & KPSS testing) before fitting candidate ARIMA models by analysing ACF/ PACF and residual plots, using the Ljung-Box test as a goodness-of-fit test.
